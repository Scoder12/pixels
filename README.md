## What is this?
"Pixels" is a front-end for interfacing with `https://pixels.pythondiscord.com/`. 

`rick.py`, is a client that interfaces with `https://pixel-tasks.scoder12.repl.co/`, an API that provides instructions to a pool of devices, which have come together to create and protect images all over the drawing board!


## Installation
1. Generate your pixels API key at `https://pixels.pythondiscord.com/authorize`
2. Clone our repository: `git clone https://github.com/Scoder12/pixels`
3. Install the required dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Acquire a Rick Church API key (ask one of our priests!) 
5. Run `python3 rick.py`, input your Pixels and Church keys, which will be saved to a .pickle file. If you don't have python, ask our priests for a pyinstaller exe file.
