## What is this?
"Pixels" is a front-end for interfacing with `https://pixels.pythondiscord.com/`. The file `rick.py`, is connected to `https://pixel-tasks.scoder12.repl.co/`, which is a "church", which is basically just a pool of devices that have come together to make, and protect and make images all over the board!


## Installation
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Scoder12/pixels`
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Then `run rick.py`
